Reentry Server Changelog
========================

0.1.0
-----

Reentry Server supports the most basic scenario for interacting with the Atmosphere Community Server test client. To wit, a user can enter a world. That’s it. Multiple users aren’t notified of others in the same world yet, and chat messages are still unimplemented.
